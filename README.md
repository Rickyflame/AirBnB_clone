# AIRBNB CLONE

This is a project by Collins Mmasaba and Ricky Kimumu, done as part of the ALX SE program. The onjective is to create a console application for our AirBnB clone.

## Technologie
- `Environment`: `Ubuntu 20.04 LTS`
- `Interpreter`: `python 3`
- `Standard`: `pycodestyle`

## Description
Creating the Console application is the first step of creating the full AirBnB clone.<br/>
The objectives of this step is to create our own data model, manage objects via console/command interpreter and store and persist data in a json file. Teh tasks in this project help us achieve the following; <br/>
- create a parent class `BaseModel` that takes care of initialization, serialization and desrialization of future instances.
- create a simple flow of serialization/deserialization; `Instance <-> Dictionary <-> JSON string <-> file`
- create all classes used for AirBnB that inherit from BaseModel class
- create the first abstracted storage engine of the project.
- create all unittests to valid the classes and storage engine.<br/>
